<b>A/B Test Name:</b> Shop Items and Prices<br>
<b>User Story Number:</b> 4 <br>
<b>Metric:</b> Time engaging with shop <br>
<br>
<b>Hypothesis:</b> <br>
The shop utilizing the ingame currency would provide a large portion of the long term draw of the game, offering new items can be used as an incentive for new users to return to the app. As such it is important to balance the shop such that it is engaging enough to the user to where they maintain and interest in it. The primary tool availbe for this is the cost of items and the items themselves. If an item that the user wants is too easy to acquire they may lose incentive too quickly, but if its too expensive the length of time needed to get the item may dissuade the user from engaging with it. Similarly, if the items available in the shop are not interesting to the user they will most likely not try to get the items, and as such the game has less features for the user to engage with. As such balancing the costs well and providing and interesting selection of items is key to the long term engagement with the app. <br>
<b>Experiment:</b> <br>
After creating and implementing a base of items for the shop, we can utilize Firebase's testing features to roll out items to portions of the user base split by percentage. We can create two selections of items for the shop and deploy each to 1/2 of the users for each, from there we can track each the amount of times the user enters the shop screen, how many items they purchase, and what items they purchase, from there we can find what items the users purchase the most and what ones they purchase the least. Beyond this we can also test different prices by giving users either above or below our base price for an item by a 20%, and from their tracking if users with certain priced items purchase more items as well as what items they purchase and we can track their overall use of the app before / after the implementation of those price variants. <br>
<b>Variations:</b> <br>
We can set a base price for items as being worth the equivalent of 10 miles worth of currency, then for the variants raising or lowering the price by 20%. For the selection of items, we can create one set of items were the items are more "basic" i.e. simple accessories and colors and more "interesting" ones i.e. with more complex designs, more and brighter colors, etc. <br>

<b>A/B Test Name:</b> Puppy Customization Limits<br>
<b>User Story Number:</b> 3<br>
<b>Metric:</b>Time Spent Customizing <br>
<br>
<b>Hypothesis:</b> Enabling users to personalize their virtual puppy within the application will help to develop a deeper emotional connection with the platform, thereby fostering a heightened intrinsic motivation to engage with the application. We hypothesise that the introduction of user-customizable puppy features will act as a catalyst, incentivizing increased user activity within the app. Furthermore, our hypothesis suggests that implementing a progressive customization model, wherein users unlock additional customization options over time and with increased application usage, will contribute significantly to enhancing user retention rates.<br>
<br>
<b>Experiment:</b> We will randomly assign new users to either group A or group B. Broup B users will have access to puppy customization features from the start, but with limited choicec. As Group B uses the app more and more they will gradually be able to unlock more customization options. We will monitor and record user behavior and engagement metrics for both groups over a week and analyze the data collected to determine if puppy customization and the progressive customization model have an impact on user engagement.<br>
<br>
<b>Variations:</b> People in group A (the control group) will be given access to the standard app with no custimizations available: just one standard puppy. People in group B (the experimental group) will have access to the application with puppy custimization. The customization options will start small (breed and collar color) and then more will be introduced gradually, with more choices becoming available as users engage with the application over time.<br>
