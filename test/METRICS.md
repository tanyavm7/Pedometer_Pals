## HEART Framework and Metrics

# Happiness
* Collection Method - The Net Promoter Score will be collected through email surveys.
   - Send periodic email surveys to a random sample of app users to ensure a broader and more representative dataset.
   - Use a tool like MailChimp or SendGrid to send these surveys.
   - Include the same NPS question as in the in-app survey in the email.
   - Calculate NPS based on the email survey responses.
     
* User Satisfaction Score - Gather user stisfaction scores through user reviews on app stores.
   - Encourage users to leave reviews on the app stores (e.g., Apple App Store and Google Play Store) by displaying a prompt or link within the app.
   - Monitor and analyze the reviews regularly to gauge user satisfaction.
   - Use app store review analysis tools like AppFollow or AppAnnie to track and interpret the sentiment in user reviews.
  
# Engagement 


# Adoption
* Download rate - how to collect the amount of downloads of the app over a recent span of time:
  - Google Analytics will be used to track number of active users on the app. If app is published
  to Android/Google Play store, analytics on number of downloads can be tracked over a span of time
* Share Rate - how to collect the amount of times the app has been shared:
  - Share feature within the app/site will allow people to share their stats/the app to others. Google
  Analytics can be used to track the number of times this button was clicked. 


# Task Success
* Pedometer accuracy - Accuracy of step tracking data:
  - Before release, numerous people will use our app to track their activity while concurrently using one or more other well-accepted pedometers to make sure it is in a similar range for the same fixed-length walk.
  - After the first release we will send out surveys to ask users if they feel as though their activity is accurately tracked and/or how it compares to their other apps or smartwatches. 
  
* Bug resolutions - Response time to user inquiries and issue resolution:
  - Any user who reports a bug will receive a survey after the bug is believed to be fixed and they can share their opinions on the quality of the fix and the length of time spent waiting for it.
