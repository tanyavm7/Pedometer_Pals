* Pedometer accuracy - Accuracy of step tracking data:
  - Before release, numerous people will use our app to track their activity while concurrently using one or more other well-accepted pedometers to make sure it is in a similar range for the same fixed-length walk.
  - After the first release we will send out surveys to ask users if they feel as though their activity is accurately tracked and/or how it compares to their other apps or smartwatches. 
  
* Bug resolutions - Response time to user inquiries and issue resolution:
  - Any user who reports a bug will receive a survey after the bug is believed to be fixed and they can share their opinions on the quality of the fix and the length of time spent waiting for it.
