Observation 2: Water Tracker
- Observation Statement: someone suggested adding a feature that allows you to give your pet water every time the user drinks water, so you can keep track of how much you drink through the app.
- Supporting Data: This will help encourage kids to drink a healthy amount of water a day
- Team Action (if any): Make a water meter to meet your drinking goals
