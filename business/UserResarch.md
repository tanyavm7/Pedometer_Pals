Observation 1: Change Name 
- Observation Statement: A lot of people found an issue with the name being pedometer pals, due to it being a children's app and having the word “pedo” in it. Also, the word pedometer might be too advanced for children to understand, making it less appealing to younger audiences. 
- Supporting Data: That was our biggest suggestion in our survey
- Team Action (if any): We decided to change the name to STEPETS


Observation 2: Water Tracker
- Observation Statement: someone suggested adding a feature that allows you to give your pet water every time the user drinks water, so you can keep track of how much you drink through the app.
- Supporting Data: This will help encourage kids to drink a healthy amount of water a day
- Team Action (if any): Make a water meter to meet your drinking goals

Observation 3: Active
- Observation Statement: Many kids are already very active and already play sports and play outside. 
- Supporting Data: Many of the suggestions for what kids do to stay active included sports, playing outside, and running/walking.  
- Team Action (if any): Potentially include different sports themes for pets, such as different sport-themed backgrounds and/or items for the pets. Can also implement ways to log activities for physical activity besides walking, such as a general exercise log feature allowing you to get points for other forms of exercise.  


Observation 5: In App Games
- Observation Statement: There was a suggestion to add mini games that are only available to play once you’ve reached a certain number of steps
- Supporting Data: It was suggested in our survey
- Team Action (if any): We will be implementing a few easy games every time the user hits a certain amount of steps (whack-a-mole, matching game, ect)
